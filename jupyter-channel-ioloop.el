;;; Commentary:

;; Functions which define new events to be added to an IOLoop for working with
;; Jupyter channels. Adds the functions
;; `jupyter-channel-ioloop-add-start-channel-event',
;; `jupyter-channel-ioloop-add-stop-channel-event', and
;; `jupyter-channel-ioloop-add-send-event' to add the start-channel,
;; stop-channel, and send events to a `jupyter-ioloop'. In addition defines the
;; new type `jupyter-channel-ioloop' which takes care of setting up a
;; `jupyter-ioloop' for communicating with channels so that one only needs to
;; do the following to start a pre-configured subprocess:
;;
;; (let ((ioloop (jupyter-channel-ioloop)))
;;    (jupyter-start-ioloop ioloop ...)
;;    ...
;;    (jupyter-send ioloop 'start-channel ...)
;;    ...)

Add setup forms to IOLOOP that will initialize the
`jupyter-ioloop-session' variable to a `jupyter-session' based on
SESSION's id and key. Also add `jupyter-ioloop-recv-messages' to
`jupyter-ioloop-post-hook'. In addition add the events send,
start-channel, and stop-channel that the parent Emacs process can
send to the IOLOOP. See `jupyter-channel-ioloop-add-send-event',
`jupyter-channel-ioloop-add-start-channel-event', and
`jupyter-ioloop-add-stop-channel-event'.

After doing the above initialization, start the IOLOOP. OBJ and
BUFFER have the same meaning as in the method definition for
`jupyter-ioloop'.

By default, no channels will be alive. A start-channel event will
have to be sent to the ioloop with the appropriate arguments to
start a channel."
